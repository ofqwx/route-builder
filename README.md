## Komoot Route Builder Challenge

## Get started

```
yarn
yarn start
```

or use the [deployed version](http://route-builder.aznarez.com.ar)

## Assumptions

The map is not real, just a picture, so the coordinates are points of a svg layer. Therefor the exported gpx file will probably fail some validation test.
